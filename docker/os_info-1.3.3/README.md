## Overview

Library for detecting the operating system type and version.

Based on [os_type](https://github.com/schultyy/os_type). The main difference of
`os_info` is that this library separates completely incompatible operating
systems by conditional compilation and uses specific system API whenever is
possible.

## Usage

To use this crate, add `os_info` as a dependency to your project's Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
os_info = "1.3.3"
```

## Example

```rust
let info = os_info::get();

// Print full information:
println!("OS information: {}", info);

// Print information separately:
println!("Type: {}", info.os_type());
println!("Version: {}", info.version());
println!("Bitness: {}", info.bitness());
```

Right now, the following operating system types can be returned:

- Unknown
- Android
- Emscripten
- Linux
- Redhat
- RedHatEnterprise
- Ubuntu
- Debian
- Arch
- CentOS
- Fedora
- Amazon
- Alpine
- Macos
- Redox
- Windows

If you need support for more OS types, I am looking forward to your Pull
Request.

## Requirements

On Linux based systems this library requires that [lsb_release] is installed.
